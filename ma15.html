	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		Spike train generation in primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1) has been studied extensively and is relatively well understood. On the contrary, the functionality and physiology of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the immediate downstream region of M1 and S1 and a critical link in the motor circuit, still requires intensive investigation. In the current study, spike trains of individual DLS neurons were reconstructed using a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson model with features from two modalities: (1) the head position modality, which contains information regarding head movement and proprioception of the animal’s head; (2) the spike history modality, which contains information regarding the intrinsic physiological properties of the neuron. For the majority of the neurons examined, viable reconstruction accuracy was achieved when the neural activity was modeled with either feature modality or the two feature modalities combined. Subpopulations of neurons were also identiﬁied that had better reconstruction accuracy when modeled with features from single modalities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of spike train reconstruction in DLS neurons and provides insights into the physiology of DLS neurons.
