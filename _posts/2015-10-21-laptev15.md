title: SuperSlicing Frame Restoration for Anisotropic ssTEM and Video Data
abstract: 'In biological imaging the data is often represented by a sequence of anisotropic
  frames â€” the resolution in one dimension is significantly lower than in the other
  dimensions. E.g. in electron microscopy it arises from the thickness of a scanned
  section. This leads to blurred images and raises problems in tasks like neuronal
  image segmentation. We present the details and additional evaluation of an approach
  originally introduced in Laptev et al. (2014) called SuperSlicing to decompose the
  observed frame into a sequence of plausible hidden sub-frames. Based on sub-frame
  decomposition by SuperSlicing we propose a novel automated method to perform neuronal
  structure segmentation. We test our approach on a popular connectomics benchmark,
  where SuperSlicing preserves topological structures significantly better than other
  algorithms. We also generalize the approach for video anisotropicity that comes
  from the long exposure time and show that our method outperforms baseline methods
  on a reconstruction of low frame rate videos of natural scenes. '
