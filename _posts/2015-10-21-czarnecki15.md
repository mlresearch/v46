title: Neural Connectivity Reconstruction from Calcium Imaging Signal using Random
  Forest with Topological Features
abstract: Connectomics is becoming an increasingly popular area of research. With
  the recent advances in optical imaging of the neural activity tens of thousands
  of neurons can be monitored simultaneously. In this paper we present a method of
  incorporating topological knowledge inside data representation for Random Forest
  classifier in order to reconstruct the neural connections from patterns of their
  activities. Proposed technique leads to the model competitive with state-of-the
  art methods like Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Decomposition techniques.
  This claim is supported by the results (5th place with 0.003 in terms of AUC ROC
  loss to the top contestant) obtained in the connectomics competition organized on
  the Kaggle platform.
