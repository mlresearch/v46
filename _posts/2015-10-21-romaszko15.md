title: Signal Correlation Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: This paper focuses on analysing multiple time series relationships such
  as correlations between them. We develop a solution for the Connectiomics contest
  dataset of fluorescence imaging of neural activity recordings â€” the aim is reconstruction
  of the wiring between brain neurons. The model is implemented to achieve high evaluation
  score. Our model took the fourth place in this contest. The performance is similar
  to the other leading solutions, thus we showed that deep learning methods for time
  series processing are comparable to the other approaches and have wide opportunities
  for further improvement. We discuss a range of methods and code optimisations applied
  for the convolutional neural network for the time series domain.
