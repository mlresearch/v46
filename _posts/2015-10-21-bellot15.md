title: Effcient combination of pairwise feature networks
abstract: This paper presents a novel method for the reconstruction of a neural network
  connectivity using calcium fluorescence data. We introduce a fast unsupervised method
  to integrate different networks that reconstructs structural connectivity from neuron
  activity. Our method improves the state-of-the-art reconstruction method General
  Transfer Entropy (GTE). We are able to better eliminate indirect links, improving
  therefore the quality of the network via a normalization and ensemble process of
  GTE and three new informative features. The approach is based on a simple combination
  of networks, which is remarkably fast. The performance of our approach is benchmarked
  on simulated time series provided at the connectomics challenge and also submitted
  at the public competition.
