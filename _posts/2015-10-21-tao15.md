title: Reconstruction of Excitatory Neuronal Connectivity via Metric Score Pooling
  and Regularization
abstract: Unravelling the causal link of neuronal pairs has considerable impacts in
  neuroscience, yet it still remains a major challenge. Recent investigations in the
  literature show that the Generalized Transfer Entropy (GTE), derived from information
  theory, has a great capability of reconstructing the underlying connectomics. In
  this work, we first generalize the GTE to a measure called Csiszarâ€™s Transfer Entropy
  (CTE). With a proper choice of the convex function, the CTE outperforms the GTE
  in connectomic reconstruction, especially in the synchronized bursting regime where
  the GTE was reported to have poor sensitivity. Akin to the ensemble learning approach,
  we then pool various measures to achieve cutting edge neuronal network connectomic
  reconstruction performance. As a final step emphasize the importance of introducing
  regularization schemes in the network reconstruction.
