title: Simple Connectome Inference from Partial Correlation Statistics in Calcium
  Imaging
abstract: In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution to the problem
  of connectome inference in calcium imaging data. The proposed algorithm consists
  of two steps. First, processing the raw signals to detect neural peak activities.
  Second, inferring the degree of association between neurons from partial correlation
  statistics. This paper summarises the methodology that led us to win the Connectomics
  Challenge, proposes a simplified version of our method, and finally compares our
  results with respect to other inference methods.
