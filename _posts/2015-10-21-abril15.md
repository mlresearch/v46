title: Supervised Neural Network Structure Recovery
abstract: This paper presents our solution to the European Conference of Machine Learning
  Neural Connectomics Discovery Challenge. The challenge goal was to improve the performance
  of existing methods for recovering the neural network structure given the time series
  of neural activities. We propose to approximate a function able to combine several
  connectivity indicators between neuron pairs where each indicator is the result
  of running a feature engineering pipeline optimized for a particular noise level
  and firing synchronization rate among neurons. We proved the suitability of our
  solution by improving the state of the art prediction performance more than 6% and
  by obtaining the third best score on the test dataset out of 144 teams.
