title: 'First Connectomics Challenge: From Imaging to Connectivity'
abstract: We organized a Challenge to unravel the connectivity of simulated neuronal
  networks. The provided data was solely based on fluorescence time series of spontaneous
  activity in a net- work constituted by 1000 neurons. The task of the participants
  was to compute the effective connectivity between neurons, with the goal to reconstruct
  as accurately as possible the ground truth topology of the network. The procured
  dataset is similar to the one measured in in vivo and in vitro recordings of calcium
  fluorescence imaging, and therefore the algorithms developed by the participants
  may largely contribute in the future to unravel major topological features of living
  neuronal networks from just the analysis of recorded data, and without the need
  of slow, painstaking experimental connectivity labeling methods. Among 143 entrants,
  16 teams participated in the final round of the challenge to compete for prizes.
  The winners significantly outperformed the baseline method provided by the organizers.
  To measure influences between neurons the participants used an array of diverse
  methods, including transfer entropy, regression algorithms, correlation, deep learning,
  and network deconvolution. The development of connectivity reconstruction techniques
  is a major step in brain science, with many ramifications in the comprehension of
  neuronal computation, as well as the understanding of network dysfunctions in neuropathologies.
